<h2><a name="PREFACE_TO_THE_SECOND_EDITION" id="PREFACE_TO_THE_SECOND_EDITION"></a>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</h2>

<p class="nind">A <small>NEW</small> edition of this work having been called for, owing to the first
edition having been for some time out of print, I have taken advantage
of the opportunity to add translations of a remarkable collection of
Poems by Heine, published for the first time since the appearance of my
work in 1859. They consist of as many as twelve hundred lines, described
partly as “Early Poems,” which will be found at the beginning of the
volume, and partly as “Posthumous Poems,” which are placed at the end.
The metres of the original have been again retained throughout.</p>

<p>Various errors discovered by me in the first edition have now been
corrected; and it only remains for me to express my thanks for the kind
manner in which the critical and the general public, both in England and
abroad, have received the work, and for the indulgence extended by them
to its many imperfections.</p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">I</span>T may perhaps be thought that I exhibit something of the
brazen-facedness of a hardened offender in venturing once more (but, I
hope, for the last time) to present myself to the public in the guise of
a translator,&mdash;and, what is more, a translator of a great poet. The
favourable reception, however, that my previous translations of the
Poems of Schiller and Goethe have met with at the hands of the public,
may possibly be admitted as some excuse for this new attempt to make
that public acquainted with the works of a third great German minstrel.
Comparatively little known and little appreciated in England, the name
of Heine is in Germany familiar as a household word; and while, on the
one hand, many of his charming minor poems have become dear to the
hearts of thousands and tens of thousands of his fellow-countrymen, and
are sung alike in the palace and the cottage, in the country and the
town, on the other his sterner works have done much to influence the
political and religious tendencies of the modern German school.</p>

<p>Having prefixed to this Volume a brief memoir of Heine, accompanied by a
few observations on his various works and their distinguishing
characteristics, I will here confine myself to stating that I have
adhered with the utmost strictness to the principles laid down by me for
my guidance in the case of the previous translations attempted by
me,&mdash;those principles being (1) As close and literal an adherence to the
original as is consistent with good English and with poetry, and (2) the
preservation throughout the work of the original metres, of which Heine
presents an almost unprecedented variety. I have, on the occasion of my
former publications, fully explained my reasons for adopting this
course, and will not weary the reader with repeating them. I have
sufficient evidence before me of the approval of the public in this
respect to induce me to frame my translation of Heine’s Poems on the
same model.</p>

<p>In addition to thus preserving both the language and the metre of the
original, I have in one other respect endeavoured to reproduce my author
precisely as I found him, and that is in the important particular of
<i>completeness</i>. There are doubtless many poems written by Heine that one
could wish had never been written, and that one would willingly refrain
from translating. But the omission of these would hide from the reader
some of Heine’s chief peculiarities, and would tend to give him an
incomplete if not incorrect notion of what the poet was. A translator no
more assumes the responsibility of his author’s words than a faithful
Editor does, and he goes beyond his province if he omits whatever does
not happen to agree with his own notions.</p>

<p>In claiming for the present work (extending over more than 20,000
verses) the abstract merits of literalness, completeness, and rigid
adherence to the metrical peculiarities of the original, it is very far
from my intention to claim any credit for the <i>manner</i> in which I have
executed that difficult task, or to pretend that I have been successful
in it. That is a question for the reader alone to decide. The credit of
conscientiousness and close application in the matter is all that I
would venture to assert for myself. All beyond is left exclusively to
the candid, and, I would fain hope, generous, appreciation of those whom
I now voluntarily constitute my judges.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xv" id="page_xv"></a>{xv}</span></p>

<h2><a name="HEINRICH_HEINE" id="HEINRICH_HEINE"></a>HEINRICH HEINE.</h2>

<p class="nind"><span class="letra">A</span>LTHOUGH little more than three years have elapsed since Heinrich Heine
was first numbered amongst the dead, his name has long been enrolled in
the lists of fame. Even during his lifetime he had the good
fortune,&mdash;and, in a poet, the most unusual good fortune,&mdash;of being
generally accepted as a Representative Man, and of passing as the
National Bard of Young Germany. Although perhaps scarcely entitled to
rank with Goethe and Schiller in the very highest order of poets, the
name of Heine will assuredly always occupy a prominent place amongst the
minstrels not only of Germany, but of the world.</p>

<p>It is only recently that his works have been for the first time
published in an absolutely complete form, the poetry extending over more
than two of the six volumes of which they consist. Universally known and
read in his native land, and highly popular in France, which was for so
many years his adopted country, the works of Heine are to the generality
of Englishmen (as stated in the Preface) almost entirely unknown. As the
present volume is, as far as I am aware, the only attempt that has been
made to bring the far-famed poems of Heine in their integrity before the
English reader,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> it seems desirable to preface it by a brief sketch of
his life, so that in seeing <i>what</i> Heine is as a poet, we may be able to
form some idea as to <i>who</i> he was as a man. One who has been compared in
turns to Aristophanes, Rabelais, Burns, Cervantes, Sterne, Jean Paul,
Voltaire, Swift, Byron, and Béranger<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xvi" id="page_xvi"></a>{xvi}</span> (and to all these has he been
likened), can be of no common stamp. The discrepancies both as to facts
and dates that occur between the various biographies of Heine are,
however, so numerous, that it has been no easy task to avoid error in
the following brief sketch of his life.</p>

<p>Heinrich (or Henry) Heine was born in the Bolkerstrasse, at Dusseldorf,
on the 12th of December, 1799; but, singularly enough, the exact date of
his birth was, until recently, unknown to his biographers, who, on the
authority of a saying of his own, assigned it to the 1st of January,
1800, which he boasted made him “the first man of the century.” In
reply, however, to a specific inquiry addressed to him by a friend on
this subject a few years before his death, he stated that he was really
born on the day first mentioned, and that the date of 1800 usually given
by his biographers was the result of an error voluntarily committed by
his family in his favour at the time of the Prussian invasion, in order
to exempt him from the service of the king of Prussia.</p>

<p>By birth he was a Jew, both of his parents having been of that
persuasion. He was the eldest of four children, and his two brothers are
(or were recently) still alive, the one being a physician in Russia, and
the other an officer in the Austrian service. The famous Solomon Heine,
the banker of Hamburg, whose wealth was only equalled by his
philanthropy, was his uncle. His father, however, was far from being in
opulent circumstances. When quite a child, he took delight in reading
Don Quixote, and used to cry with anger at seeing how ill the heroism of
that valiant knight was requited. He says somewhere, speaking of his
boyish days, “apple-tarts” were then my passion. Now it is love, truth,
freedom, and “crab-soup.” He received his earliest education at the
Franciscan convent in his native town, and while there had the
misfortune to be the innocent cause of the death by drowning of a
schoolfellow, an incident recorded in one of the poems in his
“Romancero.” He mentions the great effect produced upon him by the
sorrowful face of a large wooden Christ which was constantly before his
eyes in the Convent. Even at that early age the germs of what has been
called “his fantastic sensibility, the food for infinite irony,” seem
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiii" id="page_xiii"></a>{xiii}</span> have been developing themselves. A visit of the Emperor Napoleon to
Dusseldorf when he was a boy affected him in a singular manner, and had
probably much to do with the formation of those imperialist tendencies
which are often to be noticed in his character and writings. He was next
placed in the Lyceum of Dusseldorf, and in 1816 was sent to Hamburg to
study commerce, being intended for mercantile pursuits. In 1819 he was
removed to the University at Bonn which had been founded in the previous
year, and there he had the advantage of studying under Augustus
Schlegel. He seems, however, to have remained there only six months, and
to have then gone to the University of Göttingen, where, as he tells us,
he was rusticated soon after matriculation. He next took up his abode at
Berlin, where he applied himself to the study of philosophy, under the
direction of the great Hegel, whose influence, combined with that of the
works of Spinosa, undoubtedly had much to do with the formation of
Heine’s mind, and also determined his future career. From this time we
hear no more of his turning merchant; and it is from the date of his
residence at Berlin that we may date the rise of that spirit of
universal indifference and reckless daring that so strongly
characterizes the writings of Heine. Amongst his associates at this
period may be mentioned, in addition to Hegel, Chamisso, Varnhagen von
Ense and his well-known wife Rachel, Bopp the philologist, and Grabbe,
the eccentricities of whose works were only equalled by the
eccentricities of his life.</p>

<p>Heine’s first volume of poetry, entitled “Gedichte” or Poems, was
published in 1822, the poems being those which, under the name of
“Youthful Sorrows,” now form the opening of his “Book of Songs.”
Notwithstanding the extraordinary success afterwards obtained by this
latter work, his first publication was very coldly received. Some of the
poems in it were written as far back as 1817,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and originally<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xiv" id="page_xiv"></a>{xiv}</span>
appeared in the Hamburg periodical “Der Wachter” or “Watchman.” Offended
at this result, he left Berlin and returned to Göttingen in 1823, where
he took to studying law, and received the degree of Doctor in 1825. He
was baptized into the Lutheran Church in the same year, at
Heiligenstadt, near that place. He afterwards said jocularly that he
took this course to prevent M. de Rothschild treating him too
<i>fa-millionairely</i>. It is to be feared, however, from the tone of all
his works, that his nominal religious opinions sat very lightly upon him
through life. He writes as follows on this subject in 1852: “My
ancestors belonged to the Jewish religion, but I was never proud of this
descent; neither did I ever set store upon my quality of Lutheran,
although I belong to the evangelical confession quite as much as the
greatest devotees amongst my Berlin enemies, who always reproach me with
a want of religion. I rather felt humiliated at passing for a purely
human creature,&mdash;I whom the philosophy of Hegel led to suppose that I
was a god. How proud I then was of my divinity! What an idea I had of my
grandeur! Alas! that charming time has long passed away, and I cannot
think of it without sadness, now that I am lying stretched on my back,
whilst my disease is making terrible progress.”</p>

<p>Previous to this date, and whilst living at Berlin, Heine published (in
1823) his only two plays, “Almanzor” and “Ratcliff,” which were equally
unsuccessful on the stage and in print, and which are certainly the
least worthy of all his works. Between these two plays he inserted a
collection of poetry entitled “Lyrical Interlude,” which attracted
little attention at the time. In the year 1827, however, he republished
this collection at Hamburg, in conjunction with his “Youthful Sorrows,”
giving to the whole the title of the “Book of Songs.” In proportion to
the indifference with which his poems had been received on their first
appearance, was the enthusiasm which they now excited. They were read
with avidity in every direction, especially in the various universities,
where their influence upon the minds of the students was very great. In
the year 1852, this work had reached the tenth edition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xix" id="page_xix"></a>{xix}</span></p>

<p>Heine’s next great work, his “Reisebilder,” or Pictures of Travel,
written partly in poetry and partly in prose, was published at Hamburg
at various intervals from 1826 to 1831, and, as its name implies, is
descriptive of his travels in different countries, especially in England
and Italy. The poetical portion of the “Reisebilder,” the whole of which
is translated in this volume, is divided into three parts,&mdash;“The Return
Home,” the “Hartz-Journey,” and “The Baltic,” written between 1823 and
1826. This work again met with an almost unprecedented success, and from
the date of its publication and that of the “Book of Songs,” may be
reckoned the commencement of a new era in German literature. These
remarkable poems exhibit the whole nature of Heine, free from all
disguise. The striking originality, the exuberance of fancy, and, above
all, the singular beauty and feeling of the versification that
characterize nearly the whole of them, stand out in as yet unheard-of
contrast to the intense and bitter irony that pervades them,&mdash;an irony
that spared nobody, that spared nothing, not even the most sacred
subjects being exempt from the poet’s mocking sarcasm. This
characteristic of Heine only increased as years passed on. In the later
years of his life, which were one long-continued agony, his bodily
sufferings offer some excuse, it may be, for what would otherwise have
been inexcusable in the writings of a great poet. There was doubtless
much affectation in the want of all religious and political faith that
is so signally apparent in the works of Heine, and yet they betray a
real bitterness of feeling that cannot be mistaken. At every page may be
traced the malicious pleasure felt by him in exciting the sympathy and
admiration of the reader to the highest pitch, and then with a few
words,&mdash;with the last line or the last verse of a long poem, it may
be,&mdash;rudely insulting them, and dashing them to the ground. No better
parody of this favourite amusement of Heine can be given than by citing
two well-known verses of Dr. Johnson:</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>The exuberance of Heine’s heart, as has been well said, was only
equalled by the dryness of his spirit; a real enthusiasm was blended
with an unquenchable love of satire; “his exquisite dilettanteism made
him adore the gods and goddesses of Greece at the expense even of
Christianity.” In short, qualities scarcely ever found in combination,
were combined in him; in one weak, suffering body two distinct and
opposite natures, each equally mighty, were united. Perhaps the best
name ever applied to him is that of the “Julian of poetry.”</p>

<p>The French Revolution in 1830 determined Heine’s future life. He was
then living at Berlin again, after having resided at Hamburg and Munich.
He now turned politician and newspaper writer. His Essay on Nobility was
written at this time. He presently (in May 1831) went to live in Paris,
where he resided until his death, with the exception of making one or
two short visits to his native land. Though the fact is not exactly
stated, there can be no doubt that he received some very broad hints
from the authorities of Prussia to leave that country. From that time,
France became his adopted fatherland, and he himself was thenceforward
more of a Frenchman than a German. The Germans have indeed always
reproached him as being frivolous and French; he has often been called
the Voltaire of Germany; but Thiers perhaps described him the most
accurately when he spoke of him as being “the wittiest <i>Frenchman</i> since
Voltaire.” He wrote French as fluently as German; and the translations
of his various works that were published in Paris in the <i>Revue des deux
Mondes</i> and the <i>Bibliothèque Contemporaine</i>, or as separate works, were
either written by himself, or by his personal friends under his own
immediate superintendence.</p>

<p>Some of his more important prose works were written soon after he took
up his abode in Paris. He wrote, in 1831, a series of articles for the
<i>Augsburg Gazette</i> on the State of<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxi" id="page_xxi"></a>{xxi}</span> France, which he subsequently
collected and published both in French and German. In 1833 appeared his
well-known “History of Modern Literature in Germany,” republished
afterwards under the title of “The Romantic School,” and in French under
that of “L’Allemagne.” This may be looked upon as his most remarkable
prose work, and as the one that most exhibits his characteristic
peculiarities. The following lively description of it is from the pen of
an eminent French critic: “According to M. Heine, the whole of the
intellectual movement of Germany since Lessing and Kant has been a
death-struggle against Deism. This struggle he describes with passion,
and it may be said that he heads it in person. He ranges his army in
order of battle, he gives the signals, and marches the Titans against
heaven,&mdash;Kant, Fichte, Hegel, all those formidable spirits whose every
thought is a victory, whose every formula is a cosmogonic
<i>bouleversement</i>. Around them, in front or behind, are grouped a crowd
of writers, theologians and poets, romance writers and savans. If one of
the combatants stops short, like Schelling, the author overwhelms him
with invectives. If a timid and poetic band of dreamers, such as Tieck,
Novalis, Brentanc, and Arnim, try to bring back this feverish Germany to
the fresh poetry of the middle ages, he throws himself upon them and
disperses them, like those Cobolds in the ‘Book of Songs’ who overthrew
the angels of paradise. And when the philosophical conflict is over, he
predicts its consequences with a sort of savage delirium.... He compares
Kant to the bloodthirsty dictators of ’93, and proclaims the gospel of
pantheism. His theory of the intellectual history of the Germans is
altogether false, and should only be consulted as an illustration&mdash;alas,
too positive!&mdash;of the fever at once mystical and sensual of a certain
period of our age.” This book produced a perfect storm of fury in
Germany. “Denounced by Menzel and the pietists as an emissary of Modern
Babylon, cursed by the austere <i>teutomaniacs</i> as a representative of
Parisian corruption, Heine was not the less suspected by the democrats,
who accused him of treason. To this was added official persecution.”</p>

<p>Proceeding to his next work, the publication of his “Salon,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xviii" id="page_xviii"></a>{xviii}</span> consisting
of an interesting series of essays, &amp;c., commenced at Hamburg in 1834,
its fourth and last volume not appearing till 1840. A long essay on the
Women of Shakespeare appeared in 1839, and in 1840 a violent personal
attack on his old friend, the republican poet Börne, then only recently
dead,&mdash;a work which, with all its talent, did great injury to his
reputation. His remaining great prose work, entitled “Lutezia,” or
Paris, consists of a collection of valuable articles on French politics,
arts, and manners, written by him as the correspondent of the <i>Augsburg
Gazette</i> between 1840 and 1844. The only other writings of his in prose
that need be specified, entitled respectively “Confessions,” “Dr.
Faust,” and the “Gods in Exile,” were written a few years before his
death.</p>

<p>After the publication of the “Reisebilder,” Heine’s next poetical
production was the charming poem of “Atta Troll,” which appeared in
1841, written in a simple trochaic metre,&mdash;“four-footed solemn
trochees,” as he himself expresses it. This poem has been described as
the work of a German Ariosto, combining gaiety and poetry, irony and
imagination in perfect proportions. Much worldly wisdom is to be learnt
from the instructive history of Atta Troll, the dancing bear of the
Pyrenees. The striking interlude in it of the vision of Herodias amongst
the spirit huntsmen should not be overlooked.</p>

<p>The marriage of Heine seems to have taken place at about this period.
His wife, who is often spoken of in his poems in terms of deep
affection, and whose name was Mathilde, was a Frenchwoman and a Roman
Catholic, and they were married according to the rites of that church.
With all his love for Madame Heine, however, he seems to have been very
jealous of her, and it is recorded that on one occasion he took it into
his head that she had run away from him. He was reassured by hearing the
voice of her favourite parrot “Cocotte,” which led him to say, that she
would never have gone off without taking “Cocotte” with her. In spite of
the bitterness of spirit that pervades all his writings, it is clear
that he possessed deep natural affections. His mother survived him; and
though almost entirely separated from her for the last twenty-five years
of his life, he often introduces her name in his works with expressions
of filial reverence. His last visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxiii" id="page_xxiii"></a>{xxiii}</span> to Germany in the winter of 1843
seems to have been for the special purpose of visiting her at Hamburg,
where she resided. His friends fancied that the “old woman at the
Dammthor” (one of the gates of Hamburg), of whom he used to speak, was a
myth, but she was no other than his mother. Nothing can be more charming
than the manner in which he speaks of both her and his wife in the
beautiful little poem called “Night Thoughts.” (<a href="#page_179">See page 179</a>.)</p>

<p>In 1844 he published a fresh collection of poems under the title of “New
Poems,” to which was added as an appendix “Germany, a Winter Tale.” The
former of these was subsequently added by him to his “Book of Songs,”
and will be found in its place accordingly in the present volume, as
well as his “New Spring,” which formed a part of the same work. The
“Germany” is one of his most remarkable works, and contains an account
of his journey to Hamburg the previous winter to see his mother that has
just been referred to. None of his productions are more thoroughly
impregnated with the spirit of satire. Every stage of his journey, from
its commencement at the Prussian frontier, to its termination at
Hamburg, gives occasion for the display of his wit and sarcastic
raillery. It will be seen that many of the passages in the poem were
struck out of the original edition by the official Censors. Perhaps the
most amusing portions are the episode of the author’s adventures in the
Cavern of Kyffhauser with the famous Emperor Barbarossa (not omitting
their little conversation respecting the guillotine), and the rencontre
with the Goddess Hammonia in the streets of Hamburg, and his subsequent
tête-à-tête with her. The extravagance (slightly coarse it must be
confessed) of the latter scene is quite worthy of Rabelais, though the
poet takes care to tell us that it is intended to imitate Aristophanes.
The remonstrances to the King of Prussia, with which the poem concludes,
should also not he passed over.</p>

<p>In the year 1848, after a premonitory attack in 1847 that passed away,
that terrible disease which eventually destroyed Heine’s life, first
assailed him in an aggravated form. Commencing with a paralysis of the
left eyelid, it extended presently to both eyes and finally terminated
in paralysis and<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxiv" id="page_xxiv"></a>{xxiv}</span> atrophy of the legs. The last time he ever left his
house was in May, 1848. For eight long years he was confined to his
couch, to use his own expression, in a state of “death without its
repose, and without the privileges of the dead, who have no need to
spend money, and no letters or books to write.” But despite his bodily
sufferings, his good spirits never seemed to leave him, his love of
raillery did but increase, and little did that public whose interest he
continued to excite by the wonderful products of his genius know of his
distressing state.</p>

<p>In the years 1850 and 1851, in the midst of his fearful malady, Heine
composed his last great poetical work entitled “Romancero.” This
singular volume is divided into three Books, called respectively
“Histories,” “Lamentations,” and “Hebrew Melodies.” The first of these
contains a large number of romantic ballads and poems of the most
dissimilar character, but all bearing the stamp of the author’s peculiar
genius; the second opens with several miscellaneous pieces, including
some literary satires, and concludes with twenty pieces bearing the
lively title of “Lazarus,” and comprising, as some one has observed, the
journal of his impressions as a sick man. The “Hebrew Melodies” are
subdivided into three, entitled by Heine “Princess Sabbath,” “Jehuda ben
Halevy,” a poem itself in three parts, and “Disputation.” The Jewish
descent and Jewish sympathies of the poet are plainly discernible in
these Melodies, the most interesting of which, and probably the best of
the whole collection contained in the “Romancero,” is that which sets
forth the life of Jehuda ben Halevy, the great Hebrew poet of the middle
ages. Some critics rank this poem amongst Heine’s very best productions.
The concluding piece, “Disputation,” is in Heine’s wildest style, and
seems written for the express purpose of destroying the pleasure excited
by the one that precedes it. In none of his works is his mocking spirit
more plainly discernible. “It is the most Voltairian scene ever imagined
by the sceptical demon of his mind.” No one can read this polemical poem
without seeing how little Heine himself cared for any received form of
religion,&mdash;for the Christian faith as professed by him, or the Jewish
faith into which he was born. The piece terminates<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxv" id="page_xxv"></a>{xxv}</span> in Heine’s favourite
manner, namely, with an unexpected joke in the last line.</p>

<p>The collection entitled “Latest Poems” was written three years
afterwards. Its name shows that the end was now not far off. The hand of
a master is still visible in all these poems, the most interesting of
which is perhaps the “Slave Ship,” one of the most powerful productions
of Heine’s pen. In the year 1855, he published a French translation of
his “New Spring” in the <i>Revue des deux Mondes</i>. And now the end really
arrived.</p>

<p>On the 17th February, 1856, Henry Heine was at length released from his
sufferings in his house in the Avenue Matignon, No. 3, as appears from
the obituary notice. The smallness of the attendance at his funeral
would seem to show that there was some truth in the saying that he had
many admirers but few friends. The only names of note that are recorded
as having been present on the occasion are Mignet, Gautier, and Dumas.
And this was the man who was recognized as the successor of Goethe in
the throne of poetry in Germany, and whose songs were already household
words in all parts of that country! His humour did not leave him till
the very last. A few days before his death Hector Berlioz called on him
just as a tiresome German professor was leaving the room after wearying
him with his uninteresting conversation. “I am afraid you will find me
very stupid, my dear fellow! The fact is, I have just been <i>exchanging
thoughts</i> with Dr. &mdash;&mdash;” was his remark. Only a day or two before he
expired, he sent back to the printer the last proofs of a new edition of
the “Reisebilder.”</p>

<p>Heine left a singular will behind him, in which he begged that all
religious solemnities should be dispensed with at his funeral, and that,
although he called himself a Lutheran, no Lutheran minister should
officiate on the occasion. He added that this was not a mere freak of a
freethinker, for that he had for the last four years dismissed all the
pride with which philosophy had filled him, and felt once more the power
of religious truth. He also begged for forgiveness for any offence
which, in his ignorance, he might have given to good manners and
morals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxvi" id="page_xxvi"></a>{xxvi}</span></p>

<p>When the private papers of Louis Philippe fell into the hands of the
populace at the sack of the Tuileries in February, 1848, it was
discovered that Heine had for many years enjoyed a pension of some
200<i>l.</i> a year on the Civil List. This discovery gave an opening to the
republicans for violent attacks on him; but there does not appear to
have been anything in the circumstances of the case to make this
transaction discreditable to either the giver or the receiver of the
pension.</p>

<p>Heine is described as having lived in the simplest manner, occupying
three small rooms on the third floor, the <i>ménage</i> comprising, in
addition to his wife and himself, no one but an old negress as a
servant, and “Cocotte,” who has been already alluded to.</p>

<p>Heine is beyond question the greatest poet that has appeared in Germany
since the death of Goethe. Enough has been said in the course of this
brief sketch of his life to show the singular, the unprecedented
character of his genius, and to illustrate that combination in his
person of two separate natures that we have stated to exist. What more
touching trait of character was ever heard of, than the simple fact that
although the last eight years of his life were spent in a state of
intolerable agony, he left his mother in ignorance of his sufferings to
the very last! Yes, when stricken with total blindness, and when dying
literally by inches, all his letters to the “old woman at the Dammthor”
were written in the most cheerful, happy tone, and he made her believe
that his only reason for employing an amanuensis instead of writing with
his own hand was that he had a slight affection in his eyes, which would
be cured with a little care!</p>

<p>The following appreciation of the character of Heine, written while he
was still alive, but when the shades of darkness and death were slowly
gathering round him, may serve as a fitting termination to these few
pages:&mdash;“It may be said that Heine bears within him all the misery of a
mighty literature that has fallen from his ideal. Let this be his
excuse. But now his eyes are closing on this perishable world, whose
contradictions and wretchedness provoked his painful gaiety; another
world is opening on his mind. There,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_xxvii" id="page_xxvii"></a>{xxvii}</span> no more misery, no more irritating
contrasts, no more revolting disenchantments; there, all problems are
resolved, all struggles cease. If irony, in the case of a capricious and
ardent intelligence, could be the faithful mirror of things below, there
is no room save for confidence and respect in that spiritual world that
his soul’s looks are fast discovering. He sought for serenity in that
light raillery which enveloped the whole universe, and played his part
in it with grace; but this serenity was incomplete and false, and often
suffered his ill-cured sorrows to break forth. True serenity is a higher
thing; it is to be found in the intelligence and adoration of that ideal
which nothing can affect, that truth which no shadow can obscure.” And
so with these words of kindly sympathy, Heinrich Heine,&mdash;farewell!</p>

<span class="i0">Before a pretty country-house I stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My bosom in me moving, but my head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All peaceful, and the dust with calmness shook I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From off my travelling garments; shrilly sounded<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bell I rang, and then the door was open’d.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Inside were men and women, many faces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me well known. Still sorrow lay on all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And secret fearful grief. With strange emotion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wellnigh with looks of pity, on me gazed they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till my own soul with terror was pervaded,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As though foreboding some unknown misfortune.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Margaret I straightway recognized,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazed on her fixedly, but yet she spake not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Where is Maria?” ask’d I, yet she spake not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But softly seized my hand, and led me on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through many a long and brightly-lighted chamber,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where splendour, pomp, and deathlike silence reign’d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to a darksome room at length she brought me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with her face averted from me, pointed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Toward the form that sat upon the sofa.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Art thou Maria?” ask’d I. Inwardly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was myself astounded at the firmness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which I spoke. Like stone and hollow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sounded a voice: “That is the name they call me.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A piercing agony straight froze me through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that cold hollow tone, alas, was yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The once enchanting voice of my Maria!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yonder woman in pale lilac dress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In negligent attire, with unveil’d bosom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With glassy staring eyes, like leather seeming<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The muscles of the cheeks of her white face,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alas, that woman once was the most lovely,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blooming, pleasing, sweet and kind Maria!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Your travels have been long” she said aloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In cold, unpleasing, but familiar accents,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“You look no longer languishing, my friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“You’re well in health, your loins and calves elastic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93"></a>{93}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Show your solidity.” A silly smile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Play’d the while round her yellow, pallid mouth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In my confusion utter’d I these accents:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I’ve been inform’d that thou art married now?”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Ah yes!” she carelessly replied with laughing:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I have a stick of wood that’s cover’d over<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“With leather, call’d a husband. Still, for all that,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Wood is but wood!” And then she laugh’d perversely<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till chilling anguish through my spirit ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And doubt upon me seized:&mdash;are those the modest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flowery-modest lips of my Maria?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But presently she rose, took quickly up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From off the chair her cashmere shawl, and threw it<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around her neck, my arm took hold of then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew me away, and through the open housedoor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And led me on through thicket, field, and meadow.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The sun’s red glowing disk already downward<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That flow’d majestically in the distance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“See’st thou the large and golden eye that’s floating<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“In the blue water?” cried Maria quickly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Hush, thou poor creature!” said I, as I spied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the dim twilight a strange wondrous motion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Figures of mist arose from out the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with white tender arms embraced each other;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The violets eyed each other tenderly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lily cups with yearning bent together;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In blissful odours revell’d every flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every one wept silent tears of rapture,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all exulting shouted: Love! Love! Love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The butterflies were fluttering, and the shining<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gold beetles humm’d their gentle fairy songs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds of evening whisper’d, and the oaks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All rustled, and the nightingale sang sweetly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And amid all the whispering, rustling, singing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prated away, with thin cold soundless voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The faded woman hanging on my arm:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I know your nightly longing for the castle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“Every long shadow is a simpleton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94"></a>{94}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">“With his drawn sword, is very hostile to you.”<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And many other things in this strange fashion<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Continued she to say, till, tired at length,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sat down with me on the mossy bank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stands beneath the ancient noble oak-tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Together there we sat, both sad and silent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gazed upon each other, growing sadder.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The oak, as with a dying sigh, was murmuring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep-grieving, sang the nightingale down on us.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But through the leaves a ruddy light was piercing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flicker’d round Maria’s pallid face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lured a glow from out her rigid eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until with her old darling voice thus spoke she:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“How knewest thou that I am so unhappy?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">“I read it lately in thy strange wild numbers.”<br /></span>

<p>‘Handy in shape and size, wonderfully cheap, beautifully printed
from the Cambridge text, and illustrated quaintly yet admirably by
Mr. Byam Shaw, we have nothing but praise for it. No one who wants
a good and convenient Shakespeare&mdash;without excursuses, discursuses,
or even too many notes&mdash;can do better, in our opinion, than
subscribe to this issue: which is saying a good deal in these days
of cheap reprints.’&mdash;<i>Vanity Fair.</i></p>

<p>‘What we like about these elegant booklets is the attention that
has been paid to the paper, as well as to the print and decoration;
such stout laid paper will last for ages. On this account alone,
the ‘Chiswick’ <i>should easily be first</i> among pocket
Shakespeares.’&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p>

<p><b>Dr. MURRAY</b>, <i>Editor of the ‘Oxford English Dictionary,’</i> says:&mdash;‘In
this its latest form, and with its large Supplement and numerous
appendices, it is a wonderful volume, which well maintains its
ground against all rivals on its own lines. The ‘definitions,’ or
more properly, ‘explanations of meaning’ in ‘Webster’ have always
struck me as particularly terse and well-put; and it is hard to see
how anything better could be done within the limits.’</p>

<p><b>Professor JOSEPH WRIGHT, M.A., Ph.D., D.C.L., LL.D.</b>, <i>Editor of the
‘English Dialect Dictionary,’</i> says:&mdash;‘The new edition of
“Webster’s International Dictionary” is undoubtedly the most useful
and reliable work of its kind in any country. No one who has not
examined the work carefully would believe that such a vast amount
of lexicographical information could possibly be found within so
small a compass.’</p>

<p><b>Rev. JOSEPH WOOD, D.D.</b>, <i>Head Master of Harrow</i>, says:&mdash;‘I have
always thought very highly of its merits. Indeed, I consider it to
be far the most accurate English Dictionary in existence, and much
more reliable than the “Century.” For daily and hourly reference,
“Webster” seems to me unrivalled.’</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> I believe that a translation of one of Heine’s works&mdash;his

have not met with it. An American version of the “Pictures of Travel”
also appeared in 1855.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> One of the finest in the collection, “The Grenadiers,”
which is thoroughly imbued with the spirit of Béranger, was written as
early as 1815, when Heine was not sixteen years old, and before Béranger
had written his analogous poems “Le Vieux Drapeau,” “Le Vieux Sergent,”
&amp;c.</p></div>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
